"Each will experience being part of the Cyber Defense team that is defending against cyber-attacks by a known threat actor. The first tier will investigate and report on the actor’s malicious document by using malware analysis tools and techniques. In the second tier, challengers will discover a payload that the actor uses in the attacks and have the chance to analyze and report findings to your team. Finally, in the third tier, challengers will parse and extract the actor’s indicators that a compromise has occurred to further help the defense team protect against future threats."
